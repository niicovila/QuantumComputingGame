# Quantum Computing Game

This Game uses some basic quantum computing principles such as superposition of qubits and measurements of quantum circuits. The game was originally intended to be a React App but for some reason Qiskit-js wasn't working in my computer. As an alternative, I coded the game idea in python, as an interactive notebook. The implementation in React was done using just random number generators while the implementation in Python is made using actual quantum simulators.
